EDS-220 Final Project: Investigating the Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) of Phoenix from 2017 - 2020

# Title: Investigating the Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) of Phoenix from 2017 - 2020

# Short explanation of the goal or purpose of the repository

The purpose of this analysis is to compare the Biodiversity Intactness Index (BII) in the Phoenix subdivision in Arizona across time. Specifically, I aim to visualize and compare the loss of area with high BII (greater than or equal to 0.75) from 2017 to 2020. Biodiversity is incredibly important to healthy environments, and supports human well-being and society, and needs to be protected. Thus, it is vital to track changes in biodiversity to inform land management and conservation efforts. The Phoenix metropolitan area is rapidly expanding and building, and it is important to track biodiversity as these changes occur through time. Here, we will look at declining biodiversity hotspots in in the Phoenix area for 2017 to 2020.
